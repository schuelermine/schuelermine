# Hello. I'm Anselm Schüler

Here, you can find some of my work and some info about me.

I’m a student that lives in Berlin. I’m interested in mathematics and coding.

The programming languages I know are Haskell, JavaScript (TypeScript) and Python.  
I’ve got a bit of experience with Haskell and know a bunch, but I’ve only used it for backend, abstract modules.  
I know quite a bit about JavaScript and TypeScript, after using them for my website.  
My Python knowledge is okay.

I also know a few scripting languages (mostly for hacking stuff together), mostly Fish scripts and PowerShell scripts.

To be quite honest, I’ve never really made an actual executable project so far.  
That’s why I’ve been thinking of acquiring C and Dart.  
I’m also currently in the process of learning Java.

## Solid Projects

These are projects that I still work on, but they’re in a usable state.

- [hextra](https://github.com/schuelermine/hextra): A suite of miscellaneous functions for Haskell.
- [shell-terminal-configs](https://github.com/schuelermine/shell-terminal-configs): Some nice-looking (in my opinion) shell configs. Currently for Fish and Powershell.
- [gaussian](https://github.com/schuelermine/hextra): A Haskell library for Gaussian integers. Currently it’s missing division functionality (should be possible, ℤ² is a euclidean domain).

## Web Presence & Contact

My website is at [www.anselmschueler.com](https://www.anselmschueler.com). Unfortunately, most content of my [old site](https://sites.google.com/view/anselmschueler) hasn’t been migrated yet.

I’m personally on…

- Twitter as [@pisquaredbyi](https://twitter.com/pisquaredbyi)
- Reddit as [u/numerousblocks](https://www.reddit.com/user/numerousblocks/)

I’m also on [StackExchange, and, by extension, StackOverflow](https://stackexchange.com/users/10918971/schuelermine?tab=accounts). You might need to scroll down to see the individual accounts (like StackOverflow).
My old website also lists some more accounts that I set up to be more business-like. They don’t have any content currently.

**You can contact me per e-mail at [mail@anselmschueler.com](mailto:mail@anselmschueler.com).**
**If I lose access to that domain and can’t answer, try [anselmschueler@gmail.com](mailto:anselmschueler@gmail.com).**

## Future Projects

These are projects that aren’t finished in the slightest and shouldn’t be used by anyone (yet). They may contain stupid premises or show inept code.

- [kalk](https://github.com/schuelermine/kalk): I wanted to make a library that represents mathematical formulae and values abstractly (instead of approximating them with floating-point numbers). It currently can only represent them, and can’t resolve them.

## (Hopefully) Finished Projects

These are projects that I won’t be working on and that are done and in acceptable quality (regardless of actual usefulness).

- [turing.hs](https://github.com/schuelermine/turing.hs): A turing machine written in Haskell. Not tested, but should work fine. This was a thing I did in a day for fun.

## Trivia

- I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for programming.
- My fonts of choice are [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/), [Noto Serif](https://www.google.com/get/noto/), [Brygada 1918](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Brygada+1918), and the [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) family.
- The OS I’m using is [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/).
- I use the [friendly interactive shell (fish)](https://fishshell.com/) as my command-line shell.

- I’m male.

Thank you for reading my profile's README.
